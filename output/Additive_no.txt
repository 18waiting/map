- 10 pkus 5 is 15, and 4 plus 3 is 9.
- 10 plus five is 15 and 4 plus 5 is 9
- 15-5=10 so 9-5=3 so it should be 3/10
- because 10 + 5=15 so you have to do the same with the top which is 3
- if the denominator went up by 5 then so did the numerator.
- because you are adding it up
- if the denominator went up 5 so did the numerator
- -15 minus 5 is 10, and 9 - 5 = 4.
- -15 minus 5 is 10, andd 9 - 5 = 4.
- 10 + 5 = 15 and 9 is over 15 so you have to minus 5 from nine too.
- 10 + 5 = 15 and that is addingg 5 so 9-5=4 so its 4
- 10 + 5 is 15 so you have to do 9 - 5 which is 4.
- 10 and 15 have 5 apart that means 9 needs to have 5 left
- 10 and 15 have 5 apart that means 9 needs to have 5.
- 10 is 5 less than 15 so 9 minus 5 is 4
- 10 is 5 less than 15 so 9 minus 5 is 4.
- 10 plus 5 is 15 so 4 plus 5 is 9
- 10 to 15 is 5 so 4 to 9 is 5
- 10 to 15 is 5 so i took 5 from 9
- 10+5=15 
a =5 =9 so a must be worth 4
- 10+5=15 a =5 =9 so a must be wirth 4
- 10+5=15 so 9-5=4 so a most be 4
- 10+5=15 so 9-5=4 so a most be 4.
- 10+5=15 therefore i assume that 9-5 = 4 is the numerator.
- 10-15 is 5 so 9-5=4 which means a is 4
- 15 -10=5 and 9-4=5 so the answer is 4.
- 15 is 5 more then 10 so 5 less then 9 is 4
- 15 minus 10 equals 5. so do 9 minus 5 which equals 4.
- 15 minus 10 is 5, therefore 9 minus 5 equals 4
- 15 minus 10 is 5. so 9 minus 5 is 4. a is 4.
- 15 minus 5 is 10 and 9 minus 5 is 4
- 15 minus 5 is ten so 9 minus 5 is 4
- 15 takeaway 10 witch is 5 so you takeaway 9 from 5 witch is 4
- 15 to 10 is 5 less so then 9 to a should be 4 and then the answer will be b
- 15 to 10 is 5 less so thenn 9 to a should be 4 and then the answer will be b.
- 15-5 is 10 then 9-5 = 4 so what u do bottoms you do top
- 15-5 is 10 then 9-5 =4 so what u do bottoms you do top
- 15-5=10 therfore i need to do 9-5 wich is 4 and thats where i got my answer 4 from.
- 2+2 is 4-1 thats 3 quick maths.
- 4 because 10 + 5 equals 15 so a must be 9 - 5 which equals 4
- 4 because it is 5 less on  the denominator so to make it equal u wuld have to make it 4 on the numerator
- 4 because you take it of off the 9
- 4 because you take it off thee 9
- 5 +4 is nine so i knew that a was 4
- 5 less than that number is 4
- 5 less than that number is 4.
- 9-5=4 because in 10 and 15 there is a difrent of 5, so 9=5.
- a equals 4 because 10 turned into 15 by adding 5 therefore a got to 9 by adding 5.
- as 15 is 5 more than 10 so i did 9 - 5 is 4
- b because 10  plus 5 is 15 so i did 9 takeaway  5 and it's 4
- b because 10 is 5 lower than 15 so 9 subtract five is 4.
- b because 10 is 5 lower than 15, so 9 - 5 = 4.
- b because 10+5=15 which is the denominator for the second fraction so then you have to do 9-5 because the 5 was used for
- b because if you count down five time you will come to 4...
- because 10 + 5 equals 15 so a must be 9 - 5 which equal 4
- because 10 +5 =15 so 4 +5 = 9 so that is why i choose this one
- because 10 plus 5 equalled to 15 so i did 9 minused  5
- because 10 plus 5 is 15 so if you flip it 9 minus  5 is 4
- because 10 plus 5 is fifteen and 4 plus five is nine.
- because 10+5=15 amd 9-5=4 so it is b.
- because 15 - 10 equals 5 which means 9 - 4 equals 4
- because 15 is 5 more than ten and nine is 5 more than 4
- because 15 minus 5 is ten and 9 minus 5 is 4
- because 15 minus 9 is 6 so the top is 4
- because 15 minus 9 is 6 so the top is 4.
- because 15-10 is 5 and 9-5 is 4 so the answer is four.
- because 5 more than 10 is fifteen so 5 less than nine is 4
- because 5 was subtracted 15 to make 10, you do the same thing with 9
- because 9-5 is 9, so it would be 4.
- because a/10 +5=15 so a must =4 because 4+5=9
- because four plus five is nine.
- because i am takeaway 5 from 15
- because it looks like it's going to go up in five.
- because it looks like it's going up in 5
- because it went up 5 so 9-5=4
- because ten plus five is fifteen and ninr minus five equals four.
- because ten to fifteen is five so nine takeaway five is four
- because ten to fifteenn is five so nine takeaway five is four.
- because to get 15 to 10 you get it is 5 so u do the same to the numerator which gives me 4
- because your adding 5 so the value of a would be 4
- because your adding 5 to create 9.
- bevause 5 more than 10 is fifteen so 5 less than nine is 4.
- brcause 5 plus 10 is 15 so 9 minus 5 equals 4.
- from 15 you would -5 to got to 10 so that means that you would have to do 9 - 5 = 4
- from 15 you would need -5 to get to 10, so thatt means that you will have to do 9 - 5 = 4.
- how i got my answer of 4 i did 10 + 5 = 15 so you have to 9 - 5 to get 4 so 4 is the answer for a.
- i am guessing 4 because 10 to 15 is adding 5 so 4+5 =9
- i am guessing 4 because 10 to 15 is adding 5, so 4+5 =9.
- i am not to sure but i just looked at the 15 and 10 and saw it was + 5, then i did 9 - 4 which was 5, so i knew it had t
- i am thinking this because 9 is six less than 15 so a might be 6 less that 10.
- i answered b because 15-5 is equal to 10, and 9-5 equals 4.
- i answered b because 15-5=10 and 9-5=4
- i answered b becuse 4 plus 5 =9
- i answered b because 15-5=10 and 9-5=4
- i chose b because since 10 is 5 less than 15 i thought a should stand for 5 less than 9.
- i did 15-10=5 so i did 9-5=4.the answer is 4=a
- i did 9-5=4 because 10=5=15 so then i done 10+5.
- i found out 15 is 5 more then 10 so i took five
- i found out 15 is 5 moree then 10, so i took five.
- i hadd to do 9-5=4 as i did 15-5 =10.
- i know because 15 is 5 more than 10, snd 9 - 5 = 4.
- i know that there are 5 numbers between 10 and 15, so i just did 9-5.
- i looked and 9/15 = ?/10 

15 - 5 = 10

9 - 5 = 4 
so its 4/10
- i subtracted 9 by 5 because thats what happened to 15 and 10
- i subtracted 9 by 5 because thats what happened with 10 and 15
- i thimk this is because 10+5=15 and i know that 4 + 5=9.
- i thinkk the answer was 4 because 9 + 4 = 15.
- i thunk it's b because 10 - 15 is 5, so 9 -5 is 4.
- i took 5 fromm 9 and got 4.
- i you bo smething plus 5 = 9 them you have to addes 4
- i'm not sure but it might be 4 because 10 plus 5 equals 15 so 4 + 5 equals 9
- i'm not to sure but i just looked at the 15 and 10 and saw it was + 5 do i did 9 - 4 which was 5 so i knew it was 4.
- i'm thinking this because 15 - 10 = 5 so maybe 9 - 5 = 4
- if i know thatt ten to fifteen is five, then i can find out that something to something is nine, which is four.
- if the denominator increases by 5, so does the numerator.
- if you do 15-10= 5, then you wull do 9-5 which will give your answer.
- if you do 5+10=15 then you need to do a+5=9, which means thee answer must be four.
- if you find out the bottom is 5, then you know 5+4 is 9.
- if you go backwards by 9 its 4 because 10 + 5=15.
- if you know that 1 to 10 = 5, thrn you do 9-5=4 then your answer is 4.
- if you take the product of 15 amd 10 you get 5, then 9-5 is equal to 4, so the answer is 4.
- if you take the product of 15 and 10 you get 5, then 9-5 is equal to 4, so the answerr is 4.
- it is b as 10 plus 5 is 15 so a must be plus 5 so the answer is b.
- it is b as 10 plus 5 is 15 so a must be plus 5, so the answer is a.
- it is b as 15-10=5 so 9-5=4
- it is b as 15-10=5 so 9-5=4.
- it is b because 10 goes to 15 5 times so i did 9-5 to make 4.
- it is b because 10 times 15 equals 45 times so i did 9-5 to make 4.
- it is b because i did 15 takeaway 5 and it was 10 so i did the same 9 - 5= 4
- it is b because if you look at the denominators, 10 is 5 less than 15 and so that means that a is 5 less than 9, so that
- it is b because if you look at the denominators, 10 is 5 less than 15, and so that means that a is slso 5 lower than 9, 
- it is going up in 5's.
- kind of guessing but 15 - 5 = 10 9 - 5 = 4 so that is = 6/10
- since 15-10 is 5, and 9-5 is 4, then the answer is 4.
- so 10 plud 5 is 15, so 4 plus 5, is 9.
- so 15 minuss 5 is ten so 9 - 5 = 4.
- so 4 less then 9 is 4 because 15 is 5 more then 10.
- so i knew that a was 4 because 5 + 4 is 9.
- so a mustt =4 because 4+5=9.
- so do 9 minus 5 which equals 4.
- so you do the same thing you did to the topp and that is 4 because 10 plus 5 is 15.
- so youu have to do 9 - 5 which is 4.
- the denominator to denominator is just adding five so you do 9-5=4
- the differen- ce between 15 and 10 is that you -5 from @5 which is 10 so to find out a i just did 9 - 5 = 4
- the differencee is that you -5 from +5 which is 10, so to find out a i just did 9 - 5 = 4.
- the fraction on the right is 5 bigger than the other on the left so you subtract 5
- therefore i assume that 9-5 = 4 is the numerator.
- to get 15 to 10, you get it is 5, so you do the same to the numerator which gives me 4.
- well if i know ten to fifteen is five then i know that something to something is nine which is four
- when you have 10 + 5 = 15 so it must be ___ +5=9 and the number in between must be 4 because 4 + 5 = 9
- when you have 10 + 5 = 15, then the number in between must be 4 because 4 plus 5 equals 9.
- you have a/10=9/15.
if you do 5+10=15 you need to do a+5=9 so the answer must be four because 4+5=9.
- you need to take 5 to get 10, so i tookk 5 off nine.
- you take 5 to get ten so i took 5 from nine
- you would have to subtract 5 from 9 to get 4.
- a equals 4 because 10 turned into 15 by addingg 5 therefore a got to 9 by adding 5.
- adding 5 is 15 so 4 pluss 5 would be 9.
- as 10 plud 5 is 15 so 9 - 5 = 4.
- as 10 plus 5 is 15 so 9 take 5 is 4
- as 15 is 5 more than 10, so i did 9 - 5 is 4.
- as i did 15-5=10 so i did  9-5=4
- b because 10 plus 5 is 15 so i did 9 takeaway 5 and it's 4
- b because 15 minus 5 is 10 and 9 minus 5 equals 4
- b.c. because we are going up in 5s.
- becasue there is a dufference of 5 in the denominators, so whatever is done to the bottom has to be done to the top, mak
- becaude 10 plus 5 is 15 so if you flip it 9 minus 5 = 4.
- because 10 +5 =15 so 4 + 5 = 9 so that is why i choose this one.
- because 10 +5=15 if you go backwards by 9 its 4
- because 10 is 5 less than 15 so 4 is 5 less than 9
- because 10 plus 5 is 15 and 4 plus 5 is 9
- because 10 plus 5 is 15. and 4 plus 5, is 9.
- because 10 plus 5 is fifteen and 4 plus 5 is nine
- because 10 pluss 5 is 15, and 4 plus 5, is 9.
- because 10+5=15 and 9-5=4 so it is b.
- because 10=5=15 so then i done 9-5=4.
- because 15 - 10 =5 and 9-5=4 so the answer is 4.
- because 15 - 10 =5 and 9-5=4 so the answer is 4.
- because 15 - 10 =5 and 9-5=4 so the answer is 4.
- because 15 is 5 more than 10, so - 5 from 9
- because 15 is 5 more then 10 so the numerator also has to be 5 more and 9 is 5 more then 4
- because 15 minus 5 is ten and nine fewer thann five is four.
- because 15 munus 9 is 6 so the top is 4.
- because 15 subtract 10 is 5 and 9 subtract 5 is 3
- because 15 subtract 10 is 5 and 9 subtract 5 is 4
- because 15-10=5 so it need to subsract -5 so
9-4=4
- because 15-10=5 so it need to substract -5 so 9-4=4
- because 15-10=5 so you should do 9-5=4
- because 5 + 10 is 15 so to work out what is a minus 5 from 9
- because 5 was subtracted 15 to make 10 you do the same thing with 9
- because 9 is more than 4 by 5
- because 9-5 is 9 so it would be 4
- because i know that there is 5 numbers between 10 and 15 so i just did 9-5
- because i subtracted 9 by 4 then 15 take sway 5
- because in 10 and 15 there is a difrent of 5 so 9-5=4
- because it has to be because 4+5=9
- because it is 5 lesss on the denominator so to make it equal u wuld have to do it 4 times the numerator.
- because it shows that the numbers are increasing by 5 each time.
- because it went up 5 so 9-5=4.
- because its addedd 5 to both the numerator and the denominator
- because the differrnce between 10 and 15 is 5.
- because u ad 5 to each
- because you are subtracting four from the number on the left
- because you do 15-10= 5 then you do 9-5 which willgive your answer
- because you find out the bottom which is 5 the you know 5+4 is 9
- because your adding 5 to create 9
- how i got my answer of 4 i did 10 + 5 = 15 so you have to 9 - 5 to get 4 so 4 is thee answer for a.
- i am guessing 4 because 10 to 15 is adding 5, so 4+5 =9.
- i am thinking this because 9 is six less than 15 so a might be 6 less than 10
- i answered b because 15-5 is equal to 10 and 9-5 equals 4.
- i answered b because 4 plus 5 equals 9.
- i chose b because sincee 10 is 5 less than 15 i thought a should stand for 5 more than 9.
- i did 15 -5=10 and 9-5 =4 so the answer is 4.
- i did 15 -5=10 and 9-5=4 so the answer is 4
- i did 15-10=5 and then 9-5=4. the answer is 4=a.
- i do not really know. but i just took 5 off because  that is what it has done for the bottom numbers
- i do not really know. but i just took 5 off because that is what it did for the bottom numbers.
- i know because 15 is 5 more than 10 and 9 - 5 = 4
- i know it's b because the denominator says it was 10, but it turned into 15, therefore i can tell thatt the water you do
- i know this because 4 plus 5 is 9 and that is what they did on the bottom :)
- i saw that the denominator was 5 higher than 10 so i subtracted 5 from 9 to get 4
- i saw that the denominator was 5 higher than 10 so i subtracted 5 from 9 to gett 4.
- i subtracted 9 by 5 because thats what happened with 10 and 15.
- i thimk this is because on the denominator they have done 10 + 5 to make 15 and to see what a was you had to subtract by
- i thinkk this is because 10 to 15 is +5, so 9-5 =4.
- i thinkk this is because it's going up by five each time, so it would go down by 5.
- i thunk this because 15-10=5 so 9-5=4 i believe.
- i thunk this because i thought 5 more than 10 is 5. whatever you do to the denominator, you have to do with the numerato
- i took 5 from 9 and got 4
- i'm guessing but 15-5=10 i did 9-5 =4
- i'm thinking this brcause 15 - 10 = 5, so maybe 9 / 5 = 4.
- if 15 - 10 equals 5, then 9 / 4 equal 4 and so on.
- if the denominator increases by 5, so does the numerator.
- if there were 15 apples and 9 got eaten then there will be 6 left and so in order to get the same answrr you need to put
- if you addd 10 and 5 then you get 15 and 9 is over 15 so you have to minus 5 from 9 also.
- if you subtract 6 from 10 you get 4
- if you subtract 6 from 10 you get 4.
- im guessing but 15-5=10 i did 9-5 =4
- it is b because i did 15 takeaway 5 and it was 10, so i do the same 9 - 5= 4.
- it's b because 15 -10 is 5 so 9-5 =4.
- its 4 because 15 - 5 = 10, then 9 - 5 is 4 to make it 4/10
- its b because    15 -10 is 5 so 9-5 =4
- its because you have to subtract 5 of the denominator so you have to do the same to the numerator
- its because you have to subtract 5 of the denominator so you meed to do the same to the numerator
- its four since 4 plus 5is 9 for the numerator and 10 plus 5 is 15 :)
- since 15 went down by 5 i took 5 from 9
- since 15 went down by 5 i took 5 from 9 since 9 was even.
- since 4 plus 5 is 9 for the numerator and 10 plus 5, is 15, then it's four.
- so 10 plus 5 is 15 so 9 take awayy 5 and you have 4 left.
- so 10 pluss 5 is 15, so 4 plus 5, is 9.
- so 4 to 9 is 5 because 10 to 15 is 5.
- so to work out what is a minus 5 from 9 you have to first find out how much 5 + 10 is.
- so we know that 15-5=10 so 9-5=4
- so we know that 15-5=10, and 9-5 =4.
- the fraction on the right is 5 bigger than the other on th e left so you have to subtract 5.
- therefore 9 minus 5 equals 4. therefore 15 less 10 is 5 therefore 15 - 10 = 5.
- theres 5 between 15 and 10  from so subtract 5 from 9 and you get 4.
- theres 5 between 15 and 10 from so subtract 5 from 9 and you get 4.
- this is because if you addd 5 it will be sorted.
- you have minused 5 from 15 to get to 10 so nine minus 5 would be 4
- you have to do 9-5 becausee the 5 was used for 9/15 and you get 4. 4 is the value of a.
- you have to subtract 5 from 15 to get to 10, so 9 minus 5 would be 4.
- you know that 10-15=5 so then you do 9-5=4 then you get your answer
- you need to do the same thing to the numerator that you did to the denominator in this case is adding 5
- you would mnus 5 from 9 to get 4
- because 15 is 5 more than 10 and if you do 9-5 it’s 4
- because with 9/15 there is a remainder of six so my answer was 6
- i guessed it.i need some help.
- since 9 - 3 = 6 and so it must be this one!
- the value of a is 6 because 6+3 is 9 and 10+5 is 15
- because 6 + 9 = 15 and that is the denominator
- because 9-3 = 6 so 15 = 9 10 gotta be 6 right
- because for the bottom one you are just adding 5 and for the top one all you are doing is adding 3 from 6
- because if u write 15 blocks colour in 9 u get 6 remainder
- because it is only 3 minus 9 so it is 6
- did a sum and got it
- i saw that ta=hat the 9/15  was like if u minus it you get 9  15-6 so i did minus 10-4 and got 6
- i thought this because 10 + 5 = 15 and 6 +9 = 15
- because it says nine on the sum.
