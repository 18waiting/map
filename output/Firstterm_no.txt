- becausee it goes up by 6.
- because i added 6 in each sequence
- because i added 6 in each sequence after addingg 3 at first.
- because it goes up by 6
- go up by 6 and last question was number 4 so i just added 12
- goes up by 6 and last question was number 4 so i just added 12
- it wiuld be in a 6 by 6 grid
- it would by a 6 by 6 grid
- 1 + 6 = 36
- 36 is the product of 6x6 so yes, that is what you need to know.
- 6 timrs table
- 6x6 is 36 so yeah dats the answer
- goung up by 6 (6 x tables ) so 6x6 is 36
- i actuallyy thought it was 38 since 6 x 6 + 2 = 38.
- i think this becuase i counted them out in my head and got 36
- if 1 in 6 thenn 6x6 = 36.
- it's not a sensible answer because if it'd be 26 then it would be too small, so 36 is the only option
- we arr multiplying it by 6 because we have 6.
- you tinee it by 6, causing you to lose 6 points.
- becauise 1=6 so you do 6 x 6 =36
- because the row is 6 and theres 6 dits it's 36x6=144
- because you tines it by 6
- becausee 4 is 18 then 5 would be 26 and 6 would also be 36.
- c because i know that it is
- c is correct because its 6 x6 witch equals 36
- c is correct because its 6 x6 witch equals 36
- i am not too sure but i know that 6 x 6 is 36
- if  1 has 6  then 6x6 will be 36
- if the last question was 24 then the logical answer would be 36
- l think it c because the first one gose up by 6
- we are multiplying it by 6 with 6
