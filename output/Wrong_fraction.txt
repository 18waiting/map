- 3/8 are worth 9. i took it away from 24
- 3/8 of 24. let's divide it by eight, to get three, and then multiply that by three to get nine, so nine is the amount of
- because i found ot what is 3/8 not as a fraction
- 1 / 8 = 3 so i dud 3 x 3 to get 9.
- 1/8 = 3 so i did 3 x 3 to get 9
- 1/8 of 24 is 3 but 3/8 of 24 is 9
- 1/8 of 24 is 3 but there are 3/8 so 3x3=9
- 1/8 of 24 is 3 butt 3/8of 24 it 9
- 1/8 of 24 was 3 so i timed that by 3 to get 9
- 24 dividedd by 8 is 3 and 3x3 is 9.
- 24 dividedd by 8 is 3 x 3 = 9, so it's 9.
- 24 dividedd by 8 is 3. 3 x 3 = 9.
- 24 divuded by 3/8 = b.
- 24/8 is 3 amd then i x it by 3.
- 24split inti eights is 3 and there are three threes
- 3 / 8 of 24 is what you have to find.
- 3 8s of twenty four is 9
- 3 lots of 8 go into 24 and there is 3 lots which makes it 9
- 3 over eight is nearly a half and half 24 is twelve so it must be somewhere around 12.
- 3 overr 8 is just below a half so you take away 12 which is then 3, and that gives 9 because (3 * 8 = 18).
- 3/8 of 24 is 9.
- 3/8 x 24/1 - how many 8's go into 8 and how many 8's into 24 gives me
3/1 x 3/1 = 9/1
- 3/8x24= 9 green balls
- 8 and 24 aree multiples of 8, so it be comes 3/1 3/2 or in fractions 9/1
- 9 of the balls are green.
- hakf of 24 is 12 and 3/8 is just below half.
- i already know 1/8 is 3 so i did 3x3 which is nine.
- i answered b because 3 8 of 24 is equal to 9.
- i did 3/8 of 24 to get 9.
- i dud 3 / 8 of 24 which got me 9
- i visualized the number sentence 3/8 of 24. of course, i found out whatt 1/8 was (which is 3) and multiplied it by 3, wh
- if you draw a bar with eight sections and put three in each one then circle 3 as it is 3/8 so it equals 9.
- if you split 24 into 8 pieces, each of them would be worth 3, so 3/8 of that amount would have been 9.
- if you took 3 8ths of 24 and that is 9, then it would be 9.
- it's 9 because if i shade 3/8 of 24 then it comes out to 9.
- there are 24 8s in a row so multiply that by 3 to make 9.
- there are 3 lots of 8 in a row so they add up to 24 and there is 3 more lots which makes it 9.
- b because 24 / 8 is 3 and 3 x 3 is 9
- b is correct because 3/8 of 24 is 9
- b. you have to find 3/8 of 24, then multiply that number by 9.
- because 24/8 is 3 and i than x it by 3
- because 24/8=3 and that is one so you need 3 to get 9
- because 24split into eights is 3 and there are 3 threes
- because 3 over 8 is just below a half so you half 24 which is 12 then m=takeaway 3 equals 9
- because 3/8 is 3 then 3 x 3 is 9
- because 3/8 of 24 equals 9 ,  there are 9 of them.
- because one - eighth is 3, three quarters is 9.
- because one eighth is 3 so 3 eighth is 9
- because theres only 3/8 and its almost half
- because to find out how many are green you have to do 3/8 of 24. so 24/8 which equals 3 and the you do 3x3 which equals 
- because you change 8 to 24 which is timesing by 3 so 3x3 is 9 then there is 9 green balls
- because you divide by eight and x by three thts nine and thts b.
- because you divide by eight and x by thrre then that's nine and it is b.
- because you divide the 24 by 8 witch is 3 then x by 3 by its self
- because you would have to do 3 8ths of 24 and that is 9 so it would be 9
- cause i split 24 balls into 8 groups which means that each group has 3 balls. 3*3 =9.
- div by 8 and multiplyy by 3.
- divide it by8 and multiply by 3
- do 3 / 8 of 24 (or divide by 8, then multiply by three).
- find how many 8s go into 24 then multiply by 3 makes 9
- first you find 2/8 wich is 1/4 and then half that to be 1/8 and then add them together to make 9.
- half of 24 is 12 and 3/8 is just below half.
- i answered b because i did 3/8 of 24 and i got 9.
- i did 3/8 by 24 and got 9.
- i did 3/8 by 24 and it gave my 9.
- i did 3/8 of 24 to get 9.
- i did 3/8 of 24 which got me 9 (b)
- i know 1/8 is is 3 so i did 3x3 which is nine
- i know that because 24รท2=12 and nine is a little less than 12 . it is also the closest to it
- i know this because you know there are three 8s in  24 so you do 3x3 which =9
- i multiplied 1 / 8 by 24 to get 3 and then timed that by 3 to make 9.
- i put b because if you find 3/8 of 24, you get 9.
- i thin you have to do 3/8 of 24 which equal 9
- i thinkk this because three eights of 24 is 9.
- i this because  1\8 of 24 is 3 but we need 3\8 so you time that by 3 which is 9
- i thunk this is because 8 x 3 = 24 so 3 x 3= 9. there are 9 green balls.
- i visualized the number sentence 3/8 of 24 of course i found out what 1/8 was (which is 3) and multiplied it by 3 which 
- i worked out 1/3 and then timed it by 3 to grt 9.
- if you divide 8 by 24 and then triple it, that gives you 9.
- if you do 3/8 of 24 you get 9 so that why i thimk that there are 9green balls.
- if you do 3x3 which equals 9 then it gives you 9.
- if you split 24 into 8 pieces, each of them would be worth 3. so 3/8 of 24 would be 9
- it is 9 as you do 3/8x24= 9 green balls
- it is b because 24รท3=8 and 3x3=9 so it would be 9 yellow balls.
- it's 9 because if i shade 3/8 of 24 i get 9
- one eighths is equivalent to 3 x 3 is 9
3eights
- since 3 / 8 of 24 equals 9, theree are 9.
- since 3 x 3 = 9 thenn 3 8 is 9.
- so, it is b because 243=8 amd 3x3 =9 which would be 9 yellow balls.
- this is because the equivalent fraction in 24 =9/24.
- this is fractions of an amount so you รท 24 by 8 which is 3 then you ร 3 by 3 which is 9
- three eights of twenty four is nine
- you do 3/8 of 24 (or divide by 8 then multiply by 3).
- you have to do 24 divide 8 is 3   
then you have to do 3*3=9
- you have to find what is 3/8 of 24.
