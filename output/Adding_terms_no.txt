- 24 is not equal to 2 because 22 more needs to be added for it to = 24.
- 24+2=22 so it is d because that will give you 24.
- because if you addd them both, you get 24.
- i believe it is 22 because 2 plus 22 = 24.
- i believe it is 22 because if you take 2 away from 24 then you get 16.
- i believe this because 22+2 wouldd be 24 and y has to equal 22.
- i didd 22+2=24
- you just have to take away two.
- because 2 is there so 22 left over
- because 2 needs 22 more for it to = 24
- because 2+22=24 and that is what y means
- because 2+22=24 which is the meaning of y
- because if you do 2-24=22 so y=22
- because if you take 2 away from 24 it gets you 22
- because if you take 2 away from 24 then it gets you 22
- becausee 2 is there so 22 left over.
- d because 2 plus 22 equals 24 so the value of y must be b.
- i am not sure, but 2 plus 22 = 24.
- i believe it's d because 2+22 =24.
- i just took away 2 which equals 22
- i just took away 2 which equals 22
- i thinkk this because 22+y, which is 2 and therefore 22 + 1= 24.
- if you took away 2 then the remainder would be 22.
- im not sure but 2 plus 22 = 24
- it is d because if you do 22+2 it will give you 24
