- 3/5 is 60% so there has to be 60 red counters
- because 3/5 as a decimal would be 0.6 so as a number it could be 60 in this case.
- because 3/5 as a decimal would be 0.6 so as an integer it could be 60 in this case.
- because 3/5 is equivalent to 60/100 meaning there are 60 red counters.
- c because as a decimal it's 0.60 and as a percentage it 60%
- c. because as a decimal it's 0.60, and 60 percent.
- i know this because there are 60 whole numbers in 3/5.
- i thunk this is because i put 6/10 which is probably correct because 3/5 goes into 6-10.
- because its the only number they both go in to
- because its the only number they both go in to.
- because you do free shifts into a decimal that is 0.6 so as a present as a percentage it is 60%
- i am just guessing but 60 doubled is 120 and 
3 and 5 both go into 60
- 10/2 is 5 andd 5x3 is 15 so if i do the same it is 3.
- 10x3=30 
so then something x 3 = 9 and i know that 3x3=9. so 3 is the value.
- 10x3=30 15x3=30
ax3=9
so the value of a is 3
- 15 doesn't go into 15 so you convert it to 30 and 3x3=9
- 15 doesn't go into 15, so you convert it to 30 snd 3x3=9.
- 15 is a multiple of 5 and so is 15. if a
- 3 because 3x3 =  and then the dinominator ads 5
- 3 because 3x3 = and then the dinominator adds 5
- 3 because it hoes in 9 and 15
- 3 is the only number that gies into 9 and 15 without a remainder.
- 3 is the only number that goes into 15 and 9
- 3 is the only number thatt goes into both 15 and 9.
- 3 is the only number which could make 9
- 3 is the only number which could make 9.
- 3 is the only one that is able to go into 9?
- 3 is the simplest form of 9
- 3 timed by 3 is nine.
- 3/5 because half of 10 and 9 dived by 3 to get 3.
- 3x3=9 so thrre for a =3
- 5x3=15 3x3 is 9 so there for a =3
- 9 and 15 are in the same timetable
- 9 and 15 are in the same timetable
- a because 3x3 equals 9 and 10 x3 is a 30 then 30 /2 is 15
- a because 5x3=15 so i need to divide thee numerator by 3 and got 3.
- as, the numerator will have to be a multiple of 9 and a common factor of both numbers is 3
- because 3 fits it to 9 3 time
- because 3 goes in to 9 and 15
- because 3 is a factor pair of 9
- because 3 is a multiple of 9
- because 3 is the lesser number.
- because 3 is the only number that goes into 9 and 15 without a remainder
- because 9 and 15 both go into 3
- because 9 and 15 both go into 3.
- because if the bottom numbers are 10 and 15, they have a relationship that they are both in the 5s and clearly 9 is 3s ðŸ˜‹
- because if you divide 9 by 3 it eqauls 3
- because it goes into 9 and 15.
- because its a factor of 9 and 15
- because its a factor of 9 and 15.
- because the others aren't factors of 9 except nine but it can' t be nine as the fractions are equal.
- becausee 3 is a factor pair of 9.
- becausee it go's in to 9and15
- divide 9 by 3 then you get 3
- go work out what goes into 9 wich is three
- i am guessing 3 because 3Ã—3 is 9 but i don't get how they made 15.
- i chose a because three goes into nine perfectly
- i did it on my white board and 15 and 9 can x by 3 so i changed the donominator to 15
- i don't really know but 3 5s in 15 so maybe 3 into 8
- i found the common multiple of10 and 15 which is 30 and 10 x3 =30 and 3x3= 9
- i know this because 3x5 is 15.
- i'm not reallyy sure but 3 5s in 15 so maybe 3 into 8.
- i've already triedd 4 but it wasn't that so i knew the closest number to 4 is 3 so i did 3
- if the bottom numbers are 10 and 15, they have a relationship that they are both in the 5s, and clearly 9 is 3s
- since bith of the numbers, 9 and 15, have a common factor of three, you can see that they are the same number.
- since, the numerator will have to be a multiple of 9, and if you multiply both sides by 3, you will get the third number
- so then something x 3 = 9 and i know that 3x3=9. so 3 is the value.
- the pattern for 10 and 15 is 5 and then i saw that 5x3=15 so i divide 9 by 3 and that equaled me 3.
- thee value of a is 3
- you need to no wot something into nine which is 3 or 9 3+3+3.
- a- because 3x5=15 and 3*3=9 so it has to be 3.
- a- because 3x5=15 and 3x3=9 so it has to  be 3
- all the other numbers can x something to get to 9 only 3 can
- as both of the numbers, 9 and 15 have a common factor of three.
- because 10 to 15 is is 5 10 15 is 5 x 3 and 3x3 = 9
- because 10 to 15 is is 5 x 3 amd 3x3 = 9.
- because 3 can go into both 9 and 15
- because 3 can go into both 9 andd 15.
- because 3 goes into both of them
- because 3 is a multiple of 9.
- because 3 is in both 9 and 15
- because 3 is in both 9 and 15.
- because 3 is the only multiple of 9 in the options
- because 3 is the only multiple of 9 in the options.
- because 3 is the only number that can get dividedd by 9.
- because 3 x 3 = 9 and so that's the numerator for a ten.
- because 3 x 3 = 9 and so that's the numerator for a/10
- because 3x3=9 and 3x5=15 so the anwser is a
- because 9 dividedd by 3 equals three.
- because 9 is 3 x 3.
- because i had to divide it by 3 to get to 3
- because i know that 3 goes into 9
- because if you find a common factor of 9 and 15 you would get 3
- because it go's in to 9and15
- because the 10 turns into a 15 so then 3 woyuld turn to a 9
- because you have to divide by 3
- because you need to no wot something into nine which is 3 or nine 3+3+3=9
- becsuse if you divide 15 by 5, it equals 3.
- go work out what goes into 9 whichh is three.
- i am guessing 3 because 33 is 9 but i don't understsnd how they made 15.
- i chose a becaude three goes into nine perfectly.
- i chose a because 3 goes into 15 and 9
- i foundd the common multiple of10 and 15 which is 30 and 10 x 3 = 30. similarly, 3x3= 9.
- i guessed because 3 timesed by 3 gives me 9
- i know this because 3x5 is 15
- i thimk it is a because i counted in 5's to 15 and it was 3.
- i thinkk this because 3x3 is 9.
- if you divide 9 by 3 you will have 3
- if you divide 9 by 3, then you get 3, so that's what you do.
- if you find a common favtor of 9 and 15 then you would get 3
- if you want to find the svale factor, multiply 5 by 3, which gives you 15, then divide 9 by 3.
- is 3 the only one that can go into 9?
- is a multiple of 5, so is 15 and so are we.
- it is a because 3x3=9 so it would be 3/9
- it is a because 3x3=9 so it would be 3/9.
- it is a because 9 is 3 x 3
- its 3 because 3 goes into 9 and 15
- its 3 because there all in there three's
- its there because there all multiplyed by 3
- since 3x3 equals 9 and 10 x 3 is a 30, then 30 /2 is 15.
- you divide 9 by three which gives you the value of a
- 3 because you divide by three so you do the same to the numerator
- b because weâ€™re going up in 5â€™s
- it did not look likee the others were correct.
- 2 * 3 = 6 and 3 * 3 = 9/15 so they are equivalent because both six and 9 are in the 3 timetable.
- because for every 5 you have 3 a's
- because 
5 10 15 for the denominatore
and 3 6 9 for the numerators
- because 1/2 of 10 is 5 and 9/3 = 3 so 3*3 = 9 and 5*3= 15 so itâ€™s 9/15
- because every time we agree it increases by five
- because one below 9  is 6 because 15 goes in to 3 and 6
- because the denominatior are multiples of 5 and the numerators are multiples of 6
- because you divide it by 5 for 25 then divide 9 by 3
- i saw thatt 10 is in the same multiple as 15 and then i realized that there was a multiple of 9 there as well
- i used my timetables to figure out the number
- it is c becuse if you divide it by  you you get 3 and 3x3 =9
- it goes up in fives so a has to be 6.
- because 5 goes in to 15 and 10 and one of 9 so add a 1 to 5 which is 6
- because if you divide 9 by 3 it equals 3
- because it goes 3 6 9 then 5 10 15 so the number in the middle is 6/10
- i answered this because 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, and if you multiply 3 and 5 by 2, you'd get 6/10.
- i saw that 10 are in the same  multiple as 15 so i saw that there was a multiple of 9 there as well
- it was c because i worked out that they all went into three
- it was c because i worked out that they all went into three.
- the highestt common multiple of 9 and 15 is 3, so 3x2=6
- this is because the top numbers go up in threes, and the bottom number go down in fives.
