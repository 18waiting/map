- if you change 1/3 to 5/15 and you change 2/5 to 6/15 5/15+6/15=11/15 so 11/15 is the answer
- 3 and 5 lcm is 15 so then 1 + 2 = 3 so its 3
                                                                           
- so then 3 + 5 = 15 and 1 + 2 = 3 so its 3 - 15
- 1+2 is 3, 3x5 is 15, so you get 3/15.
- 1+2=3 so the answer is 3/15.
- 1+2=3, so 3/15.
- 1/3 + 2/5 = 3/15
i did 3x5 which is 15 and then 1+2 which is 3
- 1/3 + 2/5 = 3/15 i did 3x5 which is 15 andd then 1+2 which was 3
- 15 is a factor of 3 and 5  and 2+1 is 3 so it's 3/15
- 3 and 5 both go imto 15 and not 8 and the numerator is 3 because 1+2 = 3.
- 3 and 5 both go into 15 and 1 + 2 = 3 so it’s  3/15
- 3 and 5 both go into 15, so 3 + 2 = 3 so that's 3/15.
- 3 and 5 both go into 15. 1+2=3 so 3/15.
- 3 and 5 go into 15 and 1 plus 2 is 3
- 3 and 5 go into 15 so the domminater is 15 and then i did 2+1 =3
- 3 and 5's lcm is 15, and 1+2 is 3
- 3 and 5's lcmm is 15, and 1+2 is 3.
- 3 andd 5 both go into 15 and 1 + 2 = 3 so it’s 3/15
- 3 fifteenth's because 1 + 2 = 3 and 5x3 =15 so the end result of the fraction would be b.
- 3 fifteenth's because 1 + 2 = 3 and 5x3=15 so the end result of the fraction would be b.
- 3x5 is 15 so 3 + 2 is 3 so you come up with 3/15.
- 3x5=15     1+2=3 so it will be 3 over 15
- 3x5=15 1+2=3 so it wilk be 3 over 15.
- 3x5=15 and 1+2=3, so it would be 3/15.
- b is thee answer because the closest number 3 and 5 both can make is 15,thats why i converted it into 15ths and added th
- i just timed the bottom and added the top and it came up with one of the answers here.
- if you have two plus one then thst equals three so then you will know that the answer to this question has to be 3/15
- if you round 3 and 5 and round to 15 thenn it is 3/15.
- since u cant make 3 into 5 or 5 into 3 i found the vlosest timetable which was 15 and added the 1 and 2 =3/15.
- three and fuve both go in 15 and 3 x 1=3, so it's 3/15.
- b because 1/3 + 2/5 youu cant do you would have to convert 1/3 into 1/15 and 2/15 into 2/1 putting them together you get
- b because if you have 2 plus 1 then that will equel 3 so then you will know that the answer to this question has to be 3
- b is the answer because the closest number 3 and five both can make is 15,thats why i converted it into 15ths and added 
- because 1+2=3
3 and 5 both go into 15
- because 1+2=3 3 and 5 both go into 15
- because 3 and 5 both go into 15  and 2+1=3 so its b
- because 3 and 5 both go into 15 and 2 + 3 = 3 so its b
- because 3 and 5 both go into 15 and not 8 and the numerator is 3 because 1+2 = 3
- because 3 and 5 timee table have the number 15 and 1+2 is 3
- because 3x5 is 15 so 1+2 is 3 you come up with3/15
- because 3x5=15 and 1+2= 3 so it would be 3/15
- because 5*3 =15 and 1+2 =3 so the answer is 3/15.
- because if you do 1+2 is 3, after that you do 3x5 which is 15
so you get 3/15
- because if you do 3x5 = 15 and then 1+2
- because since u cant make 3 into 5 or 5 into 3 i found the most closes same time table which was 15 and added the 1 and 
- because the highest number you can get in the 3s and 5s is 15 so the bottom would be 15 and the top will be three becaus
- because the lowest lcm of them both are 15 and 2+1=3
- because you need to make it with a same demoniter  and its 15 and 1 plus 2 is 3 so its 3/15
- coz 15 is the first number in 3 and 5 time table and 1+2 is 3
- for this i looked at the 3 and 5 multiples and saw they both had 15 then i just added the numerators together
- i know this because 3 goes into 15 so does 5 and 1+2=3
- i know this because you need to do 3 x 5 =15 and then i knew that you needed to do 1+2=3
- i looked at the 3 and 5 multiples and saw they both had 15, then i just added the numerators together.
- i thinkk it is because 3 and 5 both go into 15 and 1 + 2 = 3.
- i timed 3 by five and that gave me 15 and added 1 and 2 and
- if you round 3 and 5 and round it to 15 it  is 3/15
- since 3 x 1=3 then 3 + 5 both go in 15 snd 3 = 3 so it's 3/15.
- the dominotars both go into 15 and 1plus2 equals 3
- the lowest commonn denomanator is 15 and 2+1=3.
- three and five both go in 15 and 3 x 1=3 so it's 3/15.
- you have to make it with a same demoniter and it is 15 and 1 plus 2 is 3, so its 3/15
- you make them into 15 and 1+2=3 so the answer is 3/15
- 1 plus 2 equals 3 and 3 plus 5 equal 8 so 8 plus 3 equal 15
