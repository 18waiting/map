- 3 it of 6 is not shadedd
- 6 is the total and 3 is blank
- 6 is the total and 3 is blank.
- because if you count them you get 3/6
- 6 parts of the shape is colored in and 3 parts are not.
- 6 parts of the shape is coloured in and 3 parts are not.
- because 6 are dhaded and 3 are not.
- because the next one is 9, so
- 9 is your answer because 10 timess 90 equals 9.
- because it has a eaqles sight so its the same
- i knew that it would have to be equal on both sides so i got d which was 9.
- the answer is d because you can't simplify 9.
- because they have to be the same
- because they have to be the same.
- 3 out of 6 parts are empty, so half is not shaded.
- The whole shape has 6 sections, and 3 of them are white.
- If you look, 3 parts are white while the other 3 are colored.
- 6 is the total number of pieces, and exactly half (3) are blank.
- You can see 6 parts¡ª3 colored, 3 not¡ªso it's 3/6.
- Since 6 parts make up the whole, and 3 are left unshaded, that's half.
- It's 3 unshaded out of 6, so the fraction is 3 over 6.
- The answer is 9 because 9 is the next number in the pattern.
- 9 makes sense because 10 ¡Á 9 is 90, and 90 relates to 9.
- Both sides must be equal, so 9 is the right choice.
- D is correct because 9 can't be broken down further.
- The sides must match, so the answer has to be the same on both.
