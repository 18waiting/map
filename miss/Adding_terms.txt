- 24+2=22 so it is d because that will give you 24.
- because if you addd them both, you get 24.
- i didd 22+2=24
- because 2+22=24 which is the meaning of y
- because if you do 2-24=22 so y=22
- i thinkk this because 22+y, which is 2 and therefore 22 + 1= 24.
- it is d because if you do 22+2 it will give you 24
- 24 take away 2 is 22, so d is right since 22 plus 2 makes 24.  
- when you add 22 and 2 together, it equals 24.  
- i did 24 minus 2 and got 22, so y must be 2.  
- because 24 - 22 = 2, that's why y is 2.  
- if you subtract 22 from 24, you get 2, so y has to be 2.  
- i think this because 24 minus y is 22, and 24 minus 2 is 22.  
- it's d because 22 + y = 24, and 22 + 2 = 24.  
- 22 + something = 24, so that something must be 2, which is d.  
- adding 2 to 22 gives you 24, so d is correct.  
- i checked by doing 24 - 22 = 2, so y is 2.  
- because 2 is what you need to add to 22 to reach 24.  
- if you take 24 and subtract 22, the answer is y, which is 2.  
- i think this because y fills the gap between 22 and 24, which is 2.  
- it is d because 22 plus 2 is the only way to get 24.  
- 24 minus 22 leaves 2, so y has to be 2, which is d.  
- when you put 22 and 2 together, they make 24.  
- i solved it by seeing that 22 + y = 24, so y must be 2.  
- because 24 is just 22 with 2 more, so y is 2.  
- if you do 24 - y = 22, then y has to be 2.  
- i think this because y is the missing piece to go from 22 to 24.  
- it is d because 2 completes the equation 22 + y = 24.
