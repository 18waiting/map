- because i added 6 in each sequence
- because i added 6 in each sequence after addingg 3 at first.
- because it goes up by 6
- 1 + 6 = 36
- 6 timrs table
- 6x6 is 36 so yeah dats the answer
- goung up by 6 (6 x tables ) so 6x6 is 36
- i actuallyy thought it was 38 since 6 x 6 + 2 = 38.
- i think this becuase i counted them out in my head and got 36
- if 1 in 6 thenn 6x6 = 36.
- it's not a sensible answer because if it'd be 26 then it would be too small, so 36 is the only option
- you tinee it by 6, causing you to lose 6 points.
- becauise 1=6 so you do 6 x 6 =36
- because the row is 6 and theres 6 dits it's 36x6=144
- because you tines it by 6
- if  1 has 6  then 6x6 will be 36
- l think it c because the first one gose up by 6
- It's like counting by 6s¡ªso 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and then 36.
- First, you add 3, then keep adding 6 each time, so 1 + 3 = 4, then 4 + 6 = 10, and so on until 36.
- If each step jumps by 6, then after 5 jumps, you¡¯re at 30, so the next one is 36.
- It¡¯s the 6 times table, and since 6 ¡Á 1 = 6, then 6 ¡Á 6 must be 36.
- I guessed 36 because 6 squared is 36, and the pattern feels like squares
- If 1 equals 6, then 6 should equal 6 ¡Á 6, which is 36
- The sequence goes +3, then +6, +6, +6¡­ so it lands on 36.
- I counted on my fingers: 6, 12, 18¡­ yeah, 36 is the sixth one
- It can¡¯t be 26 because that¡¯s only +20 from 6, and 36 makes more sense.
- You multiply by 6 each time, so 1 ¡Á 6 = 6, then 6 ¡Á 6 = 36.
- First number is 6, second is 12¡­ see? Sixth is 36.
- If 1 gives 6, then 6 gives 6 ¡Á 6, which is 36¡ªit¡¯s just scaling up!
- I did 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 in my head¡ªit¡¯s 36.
- The pattern is like a ladder: climb 6 steps each time, and you reach 36
