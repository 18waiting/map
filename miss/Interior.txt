- 144 x 5 = 720.
- 144x5=720
- 144Ã—5 is equal to 720
- 720Ã·180 is equal to 4
- 720 / 5 = 4
- because if i multiply 144 by 5 it give me 720
- because there is 144 x 5 is 720
- i think i this because they have to add up to 540 and it hass to be closed
- 144 multiplied by 5 gives 720.  
- 144 times 5 equals 720.  
- If you take 144 and multiply it by 5, the result is 720.  
- 720 divided by 180 is 4.  
- When you split 720 into 180 parts, each part is 4.  
- 720 over 180 equals 4.  
- Why does 144 ¡Á 5 = 720?
- Because 100 ¡Á 5 = 500, 40 ¡Á 5 = 200, and 4 ¡Á 5 = 20. Adding them up: 500 + 200 + 20 = 720.  
- Since 5 ¡Á 144 is the same as 144 + 144 + 144 + 144 + 144, which totals 720.  
- It works because 144 ¡Á 5 is 720.  
- 720 split into 5 equal parts is 144 each.  
- If 144 ¡Á 5 = 720, then 720 ¡Â 5 must be 144.  
- Dividing 720 by 5 brings us back to 144.  
- 144 ¡Á 5 = (150 ¡Á 5) ¨C (6 ¡Á 5) = 750 ¨C 30 = 720.  
- 720 ¡Â 180 = 4 because 180 ¡Á 4 = 720.  
- If you count 144 five times, you¡¯ll reach 720.
