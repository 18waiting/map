- first you have to turn 5 into a fraction, so it turns into 1/5. then multiply like normal and then convert to mixed numb
- i put 1 over 5 timesd it and got thayt
- i chose c because i did 2/3x5/1,then i flipped it around to 2/3x1/5 and got 2/15.
- i madr it 5 x 3 and then added the top.
- 3 x 5 is 15 and 2 x 5 is 10
- because you have to flip it, multiple it and then simplify it.
- because you have to flip it multiply it then simplify it.
- you substitute the 5 with 1/5 and do the working to get 10/15
- 1/5 is equal to 5 and so you would multiply that by 2/3 which gave 15 because the first step was converting five to a fr
- 1/5 x 2/3 =2/16
- 2 1/3 x 1/5 is 2/15.
- 2 1/3 x 5 is the same as 2/3 x 1/5 so 2 1 =2 andd 3 / 10 =15.
- 2/3 x 1/5=2/15
- 2/3 x 5 is also 
2/3 x 5/1 which is 2/15
- 2/3 x 5 is the same as 2/3 x 1/5 so 2 x 1 =2 and 3 x 5=15
- 2/3x1/5 so 2x1=2 and 3x5=15 so together it is 2/15
- 2/3x5 = 2/3 x 1/5 which is the same as 2 / 15
- 2x1=2 and 3x5=15 so it would be 2/15
- 3 x 5 = 15 and then you keep thee 2 because it's even.
- 3 x 5 = 15 so it will be 2 / 15
- 3 x 5 = 15 so it wull be 2 / 15.
- 3 x 5=15 and then you keep the 2
- 3x5 = 15 so it would be 2/15.
- 3x5 and then add the 2 on the top
- 3x5 and then add thr 2 on top
- 5 is the same as 1 over 5
- 5=1/5 so 2/3x1/4 =2/15 and 2 1/3 divided by 5 =3/2 aswell
- and we take the reciprivol of that which is 1/5.
- because i x the bottom number by 5 to getb 15, then
- first we make the 5 into 1/5 then we do apple sauce and i got 2/15
- firstly, convert 5 into a fraction which is 1/5 then do 2x1 and 3x5.
- i checked and 2 / 3 of 5 is 1/5 so that's correct.
- i got 15 because of 3x5.
- i used the flip and reverse technique.
- if yiu made 5 into a fraction it would be 1/5.
- if you multiply bothh sides of the equation by five, which is 10/15, then divide it by 5, you get 2/15.
- if you multiplyy 2/3 by 1/5 then you will get 2/15.
- the denominatorr is 2, so you multiply by 5 to get 2/15.
- the method is stick, change, flip so that it was 2/3 divided by 1/5 which is 2/15.
- when you do 2 x 1 and 3 x 5 then they are both going to be 5.
- b becaude 1x2=2, and 3x5=15 so it equals 2/15.
- b because if you do 2/3 x 5 = 2/15
- because 2 over three x 1 over 5 is 2 over 15
- because 3x5 is 15 and the numorator stays the same
- because 3x5 is 15 and the numorator stays the same
- because 5 is 1/5 so 2/3 x 1/5 is 2/15.
- because 5=1/5 so 2/3x1/5=2/15 and 2/3 divided by 5 =2/15 aswell
- because if you turn 5 into a fraction you will get 1/5. so if you multiply 2/3 by 1/5 then you will get 2/15
- because is you made 5 into a fraction it would be 1/5
- because it's basicly 2/3 x 1/5 which is 2/15
- because you don't tomes the top you leave it like you do with dividing .
- because you have to do 2/3 x 1/3 that is  2/15
- because you have to do 2/3 x 1/5 which comes to 2/15
- because you have to kfc it
- because you have to kfcc it.
- because you have to swap it into a fraction which makes  1/5 and 1/5 x 2/3 =2/16
- because you make the 5 into a fraction  of 5/1 then you do 2 x 1 and 3 x 5
- because you turn the 5 in to 1/5 so 2x1=2 and 5x3=15 what =2/15
- changed 5 to a improper fraction and flipped them and timesed them which gave me b
- do 3 timed 5 and leave the 2.
- do 3 timrs 5 then live the 2, so it 2/15
- first we make the 5 into 1/5 then we do apple sauce apple and i got 2/15
- firstly, convert 5 into a fraction which is 1/5 then do 2x1 then 3x5
- i add a 1 on the five to make 1/5 then i multiply it
- i already know 2 thirds x 5 =2 third / 3rd timed 1 fifth= 2 fifthteenths
- i did 2/3 x 5 but i changed it into 2/3  x 1/5 which is 2/15.
- i know this because you have to do 1 x2 which is 2 and then you do 3x5 which is 15.
- i used the flip and reverse technique
- i used the method stick, change, flip. so that it was 2/3 divided by 1/5 which is 2/15
- i worked it out by x 3 by 5 and then dividing
- i worked it out in my book and 3x5=15
- i x it by 2 and x it by 3 and i got 2/15
- if 3 x 5 = 15 them it is 2/15.
- if you put 5 at the bottem and 1 at the top 2/3 x 1/5=2/15
- if you put 5 at the bottom and 1 on top then 2/3 x 1/5=2/15.
- it is b because 3 x 5 = 15 so it is 2/15
- it would be 2/15 because 3x5 equals 15
- its b because  3 * 5 = 15 add 2 is 2 over 15
- its b because 3 * 5 = 15 add 2 is 2 over 15
- let's say 5 is 1/5. them 2/3 x 1/15 = 2/15.
- multiplying by 5 is the same as multiplying by 1/5.
- put a 1 over the 5 so it is then 2×1 and 3×5
- reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 so 2/3 x 1/5=2/15
- remembering flip and kiss i did the calculation and got 2/15
- so 2x1=2 and 5x3=15 so what =2/15
- so basically 3 x 5 is 15 so we put that at the bottom and the top stays the same
- so basically 3 x 5 is 15 so we put that at the bottomm and the top stays the same
- so you do 3*5=15 and then i normally do 2* imaginary 1=2 and 2/15 is youre anser
- the result of 3x5 is 15 and the numorator stays the same.
- we change 5 into 5/1 and we use he recipricol of that wich is 1/5
- when i remembered flip and kiss i did the calculation and got 2/15
- when you multiply 5 by the demoninator it comes out to be 2/15.
- when you multiply a fraction, you only timrs it by the bottom number.
- yiu take 5 and multiply it by 1 over 5.
- you do one fifth time by two third
- you do one fifth time by two thirds
- you have to do 2/3 x 1/5 which comes to 2/15
- you make 5 into a fraction (1/5) and then do 2 x 1= 2 and 3 x 5=15. so the top of the fraction is 2 and the bottom is 15
- you make 5 into a fraction (1/5) and then do 2 x 1=2 and 3 x 5 =15. so the top of the fraction is 2 and the bottom is 15
- you turn 5 into a fraction which is 1 over 5 and then mutliply  it
