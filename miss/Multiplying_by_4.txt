- you have to take the original time by 4 to get your answer.
- 12 duvided by 3 is 4 so 192 x 4 = 768
- 192 / 3 = 64 then you tumes it by 12 =768
- 192 x 4 = 768
- you do 192/3 which is 64 andd then do 64x12 which was 768.
- because i multiple it by 4
- you do 192/3 which is 64 and then do 64x12 which is 768
