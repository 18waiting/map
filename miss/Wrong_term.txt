- because the number is increasing by 4 each timee
- 22, there would be another line of 4 + 1 extra dot at the end.
- 4n+2 this is because four is the gap between each of the numbers therefore making the answerr 22.
- because i did 5 on accident.
- for examplee 4 is next, so 4 x 5 + 2 = 22.
- i think thus because 20 plus 2 is 22.
- if you addd 3 on a stack then one more you will have 18+4=22.
- just sdd 3 and the last one was 19.
- since 18 plus 4 is 22. so, the answer is 18.
- so we addd four in of them 18+4 in total.
- there is another similarity that it increases by 4 and 18+4 is 22.
- when writing the letter o, there would be another line of 4 + 1 extra dot at the end.
- you have to addd the extra two on the side and you get 22
- you will get 6 lots of 4 and 2 which is 22.
- and then you addd 4 to every one that has 18 so that you would get 22.
- because 4 is being added on so 18+4=22
- because 4 is being added on so 18+4=22
- because because you have 5 on the top row
- because for every sequence, it's plus 4.
- because for every sequence, it's plus 4.
- because it increases by four.
- because it is linear sequence and the difference is 4
- because the next number in the sequence is +4 and 18+4=22.
- because the sequence increases by 4
- because the sequence is +4 and 18+4=22
- because the term to term rule is +4
- because there will be five lines of4 circles and the extra 2 will make 22.
- because you will get 6 lots of 4 and 2 which is 22
- bevause the term to term rule is +4.
- each dot is added by 4 so in thee end 4+18=22
- hence, the sequencr increases by 4.
- i added 4 to 18 andd it gave me the answer 22
- i think that it is 22 because the sequence follows the expression 4n+2. therefore, the 5th term will go 4*5+2 this equat
- i think that it is 22 because the sequence follows the expression 4n+2. therefore, the 5th term will go 4*5+2. this equa
- i think this because i added on four
- i think this is because i added on four
- it is a linear sequence and thee difference is 4
- it will be 5 rows of 4 and 2 left over so the answer would be 22
- my reasoning is 18 plus 4 is 22
- so if you do 18 plus 4 it's 22, so that'd
- so we 18+4 in of them
- starting from 6 and sdding 4 you get that
- the sequence is +4 and the 4th figure has 18. 18+4=22.
- there will be 5 rows of 4 and 2 left over so the answer would be 22.
- they go up in 4s so 4 after 18 is 22
- theyy go up by 4s so 4 after 18 is 22.
- this because you sdd 4 to each one.
- this is due to the fact that each successive indent increases by 4, 18 + 4 = 22.
- this means that after 6, 10, 14, 18... we will have 22.
- when you start with 6 then it will be 10, then 14 then 18 then thee answer would be 22
- on each term one line of 4 blue circles are added.
- i think this because it is always in 4.
- i think this because its always in 4
