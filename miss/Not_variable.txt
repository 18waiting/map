- (y) = 24 so i chosr 4/a.
- 2 plus y would be 4 because 2 and 4 together make 24
- 2 plus y would be 4 because two and four together make 24.
- 2 would be representing 20 so 4 must be y
- 2 would be representing 20 so 4 must be y
- 24 - 4 = 2y, so y is the value of 4.
- 24 = 24, so y must be a 4.
- 24 = 2y so thee y must be 4
- 24 and no sum so it must be 24 on the other side therefore y=4
- 24 has 4 in the units column, so it might be 4.
- 24 is just like 24, so it must be 4.
- 24 is the same as 2? so it has to be 4
- 24 so it has to be 4.
- 4 because you need 4 to make 24
- 4 is in the ons to equle 24
- because it is an = sign so the value would have to be 4 to make the question right.
- bevause there is a 4 on the end of 24
- if 2y is = to 24, then y hass to be 4.
- if we replaced the two with twenty, then 4 would be correct.
- the second term is 20, so the y must be 4.
- you need another four on the end to make it 24.
- again it must be 4 because you have 20 and you need 24 you need 4 more
- because 24 = 24 so y must be a 4
- because 24 =2y so the y must be 4
- because 24 is the same as 24 so it is 4
- because 2y = 24 and 4 is the value of y
- because 2y = 24 so i made it so it is y = 4
- because 4 is in the units colom
- because 4 is in the units colom.
- because if 2y = 24 then y must = 4
- because if it = 24 then the y must be 4.
- because if you replace y with 4 then you get 24
- because if you replace y with 4 you get 24
- because it is an = sign so the value would have to be 4 to make the question right.
- because it says (2y) = 24 so i chose the 4/a.
- because there is a 4 on the end of 24
- because there is already 20 so y must be 4
- because were the y is the 4 shoud go
- because were the y is where the 4 should go
- because you have the twenty but not the 4.
- becuse combine 2 and 4 u get 24
- i believe this because 24 is the same as 24, so it's most likely going to be a 4.
- i have already found 20 so there must be 4 left.
- i made it so it is y = 4 because 2x = 24.
- i thinkk this because it was the on page 2y=24so that is how's it is 4
- i will assume it to be a 24 as there sre four at the end.
- if 2y is = to 24 then the y has to be 4
- if itâ€™s equivalent then y must be 4
- ithink it is 4 because it = 24
- otherwise how would you have 4 !
- so 2y=24 so it has to be 4 because 24 is the same as 4.
- the 2 is 20 so the y must be 4
- the digits 2 and 4 go together to get 24
- the value of y is 4 because 24=24
- the y would be 4 because there is the 2 which represents 20
- this is because, once again, we have the second digit after 2, that being 4, so this is why i believe y = 4.
- y = 4 becausee 24=24
- y = 4. if it is equivalent then the numberr 4 must be.
- y is 4 because 2y is the same as 24
- y=4 because 2 x is the same as 24
- you need a four on the end to make it 24
- you need four more because you have 20 and you need 24.
- youu have the twenty but not the four.
