- since itâ€™s less than 0 then it can nott be done.
- it is very unlikelyy but it can still happen as it has a percentage.
- because it is higher than zero but not 5
- c as immpossible is 0 and certain is 0.100.
- if 1 is 50% then 0.9 must be leds than 50 which is half.
- it could happen but no where near 100% sure
- Since the value is negative, it¡¯s not possible¡ªprobabilities can¡¯t be below zero.
- Even though the chance is tiny, it¡¯s not zero, so it could still happen.
- It¡¯s above zero but not big enough to be likely¡ªdefinitely not 5%.
- A probability of 0 means impossible, and 1 (or 100%) means certain.
- If 0.5 is 50%, then 0.9 must be way more than half¡ªalmost certain!
- There¡¯s a small chance, but we¡¯re far from being completely sure.
