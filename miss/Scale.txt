- since itâ€™s less than 0 then it can nott be done.
- i think this because there is moree than 0 probability but very less as well.
- it is very unlikelyy but it can still happen as it has a percentage.
- because 0.9 is lower than 1 and bigger than 0
- because it is higher than zero but not 5
- because it is not a likely more that 50 percent
- because it's not veryy likely to get an event if its 0.
- c as immpossible is 0 and certain is 0.100.
- i think this because as all probabilities add up to 1, 1 - 0.9 is 0.91.
- if 1 is 50% then 0.9 must be leds than 50 which is half.
- it could happen but no where near 100% sure
- its only 0.9 percent chancr for it to happen.
- l think this because the event is under five percent.
- the probability is less than 50%
- the probability is lesss than 50%
