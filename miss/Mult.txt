- 1 / 2 of 6 is 3, so the snswer is b.
- because all you are doing is halting it
- because you only find halff of 6.
- i basically means 1/2 of 6 which is 3
- i'm confused so i just thought it would be 1/2 of 6
- it is b because you do 1/2 x 6 which is 3.
- its just asking you halff of six
- since hakf of six equals three.
- when you turn 6/2 into an mixed number it turns into 3. i multiplied my whole number by the numerator. the answer could 
- i flipped the fraction and multiplied it by 6 and i got 3.
- i multiplied my whole number by the numerator. the amswer could also be 6.
- it is b because you do 1/2 x 6 which is 3
- 1 x 6 = 6 you leave the denominater though
- because you still have two at the bottom and do 1x6
- because 1x6 is 6 and you have to keep thee denominator the same.
- because i did it like two fractions then i add them together and i got 6/2
- i worked it by multiplying thee numerator by the integer while keeping the bottom number the same.
- because you still have 2 at the bottom and do 1x6
- if you make 6 wholes into a fraction, it would be 6/1. then you do 1/2 x 6/1, which will equal 6/2
- if you make 6 wholes into a fraction, it would be 6/1. then you do 1/2 x 6/2, which will equal 6/2.
