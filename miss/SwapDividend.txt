- 2x3=6 so 6 dived by 2 =3  1/2= dived by 2
- 2x3=6 so 6 dived by 2 =3 1/2= divee by 2.
- 6 dividedd by 2 is equal to 3.
- b because 6/2 is equal to 3
- i dvidid 6 dvidid by 2 to get 3
- i thunk this i need to split 6 by 2.
- b because 6/2 is equak to 3.
- because their are 6 1/2 in 6 so it would be 3
- dividing is the same as of spo i did 6divided 2 is 3 x1 is 3.
- 1/2÷6 is impossible so i did 6÷1/2 equals 12 so it’s 1/12
- 6/ 1/2 = 12 
so switching them would be 1/12
- 6 ~2 is 3 and that was the only one with a denominator of 3
- i looked at how many 2s go into 6.
- if you find out how many 2s go into 6 which is 3 then you keep the top number the same and you get 1/3.
- so if you do 6÷2 you would get 3 and you cant do 6÷1 so you eave it as 1
- because 6 can be halved into 3
- i looked at how many 2s go into 6
- so if you do 62 you would get 3, and you cant do 16 so you leave it as 1.
- 6/2 as you swap the 2 at the top meaning its 6 and you leave the denominator
- because  when you see how many 2 goes into 6 it equals 3
- because when you see how many 2's go into 6 it equals 3
- i know this because using the 'keep, change, flip'
method it is 6/2
- i know this because using the 'keep, change, flip' method it is 6/2.
- its d because u add 2 udder the 6.
