- 2x3=6 so 6 dived by 2 =3  1/2= dived by 2
- 2x3=6 so 6 dived by 2 =3 1/2= divee by 2.
- 6 dividedd by 2 is equal to 3.
- b because 6/2 is equal to 3
- i dvidid 6 dvidid by 2 to get 3
- i thunk this i need to split 6 by 2.
- b because 6/2 is equak to 3.
- because their are 6 1/2 in 6 so it would be 3
- dividing is the same as of spo i did 6divided 2 is 3 x1 is 3.
- 1/2梅6 is impossible so i did 6梅1/2 equals 12 so it鈥檚 1/12
- 6/ 1/2 = 12 
so switching them would be 1/12
- 6 ~2 is 3 and that was the only one with a denominator of 3
- if you find out how many 2s go into 6 which is 3 then you keep the top number the same and you get 1/3.
- so if you do 6梅2 you would get 3 and you cant do 6梅1 so you eave it as 1
- because 6 can be halved into 3
- because  when you see how many 2 goes into 6 it equals 3
- because when you see how many 2's go into 6 it equals 3
- its d because u add 2 udder the 6.
- 2 × 3 = 6, so if you split 6 into 2 parts, each part is 3. That’s why 6 ÷ 2 = 3.
- If you have 6 things and split them into groups of 2, you get 3 groups. So 6 divided by 2 is 3.
- Half of 6 is 3, because dividing by 2 means splitting into two equal parts.
- 6 cut in half is 3, so 6 ÷ 2 = 3.
- If you share 6 between 2 people, each gets 3. 
- You can think of 6 ÷ 2 as 'how many 2s fit into 6?' The answer is 3 
- Dividing 6 by 2 is like asking, 'What number times 2 gives 6?' The answer is 3
- 6 split into 2 equal pieces makes 3 in each piece 
- If 2 × 3 = 6, then reversing it gives 6 ÷ 2 = 3
- Division is like sharing—6 shared between 2 is 3 each
