- its d because the total is 9 and the not shaded ones are 3 so its 3/9.
- its because 3/9 shapes aren't shaded
- its because there 9 triangles and only 6of those triangles have been shaded so i did 9-6=3 and the answer is 3/9
- its because there are 3 not shaded and then there is 9 all together
- it’s 3/9 because when you count all of the triangles together it equals 9 and 3 of them is not shaded.
- i’m not sure i’m right but i counted how many triangle there were which were nine so there are three that are not shaded
- i’m thinking this becausy it shades six als leave 3, s it 3 / 9.
- max is 9 triangles and 3 is not shaded
- nine triangles and three aren't shaded in.
- out of the 9 pieces there is 3 not shaded making it 3/9 and the answer d.
- overall the triangle has 9mini triangles and 3 are white
- since there are 9 triangles and 6 of them are shaded that means 3 of them are not shaded
- since there aree 9 triangles in total but only three aren’t shaded meaning 3/9 are not colored.
- so it's 3 out of 9 because there are 3 unshaded triangles.
- so the snswer is 3/9.
- so the whole thing is 9 and 3  are not shade
- t
