- 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 
because you are finding how much is left
- 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 and he has eaten 1 third of the piece left, 1 third of the price to begin with
- 2/3 - 1/3 is what the sentences mean
- 2/3 are there and 1/3 has been eaten. therefore you have 2/3-1/3
- as sally has 2/3 ad he eats1/3 you need to do 2/3 - 1/3
- beacuse two thirds -one third =one third
- because 2 thirds take 1 third =1 third
- because 2-1=1 and there is 1/3 left
- because 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 and sally has 1/3 left
- because eaten=  -  and there's  one third left
- because he eaten 1/3 so it would be 2/3 - 1/3
- because he has eaten 1 third so he's minuses 1 third
- because he takes something which means -
- because he took some from the other section so it’s subtract
- because if his eating he is subracting
- because if you want to find out how much did he eat you have to subtract
- because in the fridge there was 2/3 somebody takes 1/3 of that remaining piece which is d
- because she has 2/3 and 1/3 was eaten so it is saying 2/3 take 1/3
- because there is 1/3 left so the sum is 
2/3-1/3=1/3
- because there is 1/3 left you would do 2/3-1/3 which would give you 1/3
- because there was 2/3 there and then 1/3 was eaten!
- because there will only be one third left and you subtract
- because you are taking one therd from two therds
- because you have to take 1/3 from 2/3 to make 1/3
- because you have to work out 2 ,3rds and then subtract 1 ,3rd.
- because you take 1 third from 2 thirds = 1 third
- d as 2/3 - 1/3 would be the appropriate calculation to solve the problem
- d because 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 and that is the calculation i did.
- d because he has eaten 1/3 from 2/3 so it would be subtraction
- d because sally has 2/3 and you take
2/3-1/3=1/3 left
- it is d because you start off with 2/3 and you subtract 1/3 which is shown by d
- it would be subtract because he has taken it and eaten it
- it’s because it was 2 thirds and now it’s one third so it is just subtracting
- that's what u get if u subtact 2 by 1
- the number sentence would be d because he has eaten so it would be a subtraction.
- there is 2/3 and you need to subtract 1/3.this leaves you with 1/3

2/3-1/3=1/3
- there was 2/3 then he took 1/3 so that would be 2/3 - 1/3
- there's used to be 3/3 but now there is 2/3 but they eat 1/3 so 2/3 -1/3 = 1/3
- two thirds - one third is one third
- you want to find how much he has eaten so you just subtract.
